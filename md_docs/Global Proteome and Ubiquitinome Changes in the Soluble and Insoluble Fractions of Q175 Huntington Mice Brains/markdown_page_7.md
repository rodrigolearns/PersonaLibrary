downregulation of proteins in the soluble fraction did not result in significant upregulation of those proteins in the insoluble fraction, suggesting that changes in protein relative abundances in the soluble fraction observed in our study were rather the result of changes in protein synthesis and/or degradation than in sequestration in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 2D). We identified multiple diGly peptides for Htt. Fig. 2E shows all identified diGly peptides from Htt in the quadruplicate samples in both the soluble (upper panel) and insoluble fractions (lower panel). Intensities were log2 transformed sum of raw intensities from the MaxQuant evidence files. We identified diGly peptides with Htt K6, K9, K132, K804, and K837 in the soluble fractions while in the insoluble fraction only diGly peptides with Htt K6 and K9 were found. In the insoluble fraction, singly modified diGly peptides with Htt K6 and with Htt K9 were identified in almost all replicates and log2 intensities were clearly higher in mutant samples, suggesting that K6 and K9 were more ubiquitinated in mutant Htt insoluble fractions (Fig. 2E). Also, the Student’s t test revealed that Htt K6 and K9 diGly sites were significantly upregulated in mutant Htt insoluble fractions (Fig. 2B). In contrast, in the soluble fraction diGly peptides harboring the same GlyGly sites were primarily identified in the mutant samples, whereas the Htt protein level was strongly reduced in these samples (Fig. 2B), suggesting that ubiquitination of Htt at K6 and K9 is predominantly occurring with the mutant protein in the soluble fraction of our samples (Fig. 2E). Htt could also be ubiquitinated at 

K6 and K9 simultaneously, as we identified two different peptides harboring both modifications (Fig. 2E). Moreover, diGly peptides for Htt K132 and K804 were primarily identified in the wild-type samples, suggesting that ubiquitination at these sites specifically occurred with the wtHtt samples under the used conditions. Finally, the Htt diGly peptide harboring K837 was only identified in 1 out of the 8 samples, indicating that ubiquitination at this site occurs almost never or only rarely in our model under the used conditions. Concluding, we observed changes in both the global proteome and ubiquitinmodified proteome of the Q175 HD mice model as compared with the wild type. Typically, the Htt protein level was remarkably decreased in the soluble fraction of the HD mice model and the mHtt protein was more ubiquitinated at K6 and K9 in both the soluble and insoluble fractions whereas K132 and K804 were more ubiquitinated in the wtHtt protein in the soluble fraction. Htt diGly peptides harboring K837 were only found in one wild-type sample. Proteins with Roles in Membrane Organization, Translation, and Catabolic Processes Are Differentially Ubiquitinated in the Soluble Fraction of Wild-type and HD Mice Brains—Next we performed functional analyses on differentially expressed proteins and diGly sites. Visualization of the protein-protein association network for up- and downregulated proteins and diGly sites using the stringApp (42) in Cytoscape (32) revealed that the association network for diGly sites is particularly dense as compared with the association network for proteins (Fig. 3A and 3B). Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis revealed that Biological Processes related with transport, localization and metabolic processes were enriched in the group of differentially expressed proteins and diGly sites in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3C and 3D). Highly interconnected clusters were found in the proteinprotein association network of up and downregulated diGly sites with the use of Cytoscape plugin MCODE (Fig. 3E). Proteins in the highest scoring clusters played roles in membrane organization and transport (cluster 1), translation (cluster 2) and catabolic processes (cluster 3 and 4). Functional Analysis of Global Proteome and Ubiquitinome Changes in the Insoluble Fraction of Wild-type and HD Mice Brains—We also performed a functional network analysis of up- and downregulated proteins and diGly sites in the insol

FIG. 2. Visualization of quantitative data. A, Heatmaps (Euclidian Distance) of log2 transformed LFQ intensities of identified and quantified proteins and diGly sites for all data sets. Lowest intensities are shown in blue and highest intensities are shown in orange. B, Volcano plots showing protein or diGly site relative abundances for all data sets. Orange: proteins/diGly sites up in mutant Htt mice brain; blue: proteins/diGly sites up in wtHtt mice brain. C, SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the quadruplicate wtHtt and mHtt brain lysates with antibodies against both Htt Proline 1220 region and N terminus and actin (loading control) confirm decreased Htt protein levels in mHtt mice brain in the soluble global proteome. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the quadruplicate wtHtt and mHtt brain lysates with an antibody against Vimentin confirms increased Vimentin protein levels in mHtt mice brain in the insoluble global proteome. Full-length (and probably fragments of) Htt was detected with the antibody raised against Htt N terminus only in mHtt insoluble fractions. D, Venn diagram showing number of proteins that were significantly up and down in soluble and insoluble fractions. Only the proteins that pass the fold change and p value threshold in the t test (those marked in color in the volcano plots) are shown. E, The bar plots showing the log2 intensities of the diGly peptides of the Huntingtin protein in soluble and insoluble fractions. The intensities are the raw intensities from the MaxQuant evidence file. Modified sequences that have a C-term diGly are excluded.
