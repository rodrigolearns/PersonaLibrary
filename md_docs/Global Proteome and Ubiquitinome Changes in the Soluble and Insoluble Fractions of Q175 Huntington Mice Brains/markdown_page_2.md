Although differences in phosphorylation between wtHtt and mHtt have been shown by various research groups, much less is known about differences in ubiquitination between wtHtt and mHtt. Several studies have reported the effects of ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) on aggregate formation by mHtt (15–19), indicating that altering the ubiquitination of mHtt improves the turnover of the mutant protein and decreases aggregate formation (20–22). However, it is unknown whether mHtt is differentially ubiquitinated because of the polyQ expansion. Again, the N17 domain is of interest, as it contains three lysine residues that may become ubiquitinated and thereby affect clearance but also regulate modifications of other PTMs (23, 24). To examine whether full-length (fl) mHtt is differentially ubiquitinated compared with wtHtt, we applied a mass spectrometry-based workflow in which we used K-�-GG antibodies to purify diGly-modified peptides from both wild-type and mutant Htt mice brain samples. We used the Q175 knock-in mouse model (also called Q175F neo delete/Q175FDN) that contains a human mHtt exon1 with the expanded CAG repeat within the native mouse huntingtin gene. Both homo- and heterozygous Q175 mice show first signs of motor symptoms at the age of 3–4 months, and behavioral deficits are observed at the age of 8 months (25). The mice used for this study were 40 weeks (10 months) old representing an advanced stage of HD. Further, the Q175 mice used were homozygous, lacking wtHtt, as no discrimination between wtHtt and mHtt peptides can be made upon digestion for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. To separate soluble Htt from aggregated Htt we used a mild lysis buffer containing Triton X-100 which does not dissolve aggregated Htt (26). Thus, insoluble fractions contain putative mHtt aggregates, among other proteins present in the lysate pellet. Here, we show that wild-type Htt was mainly ubiquitinated at K132, K804, K837 in the soluble fraction. In contrast, the mutant Htt protein level was strongly reduced in the soluble fraction and it was ubiquitinated at K6 and K9. In the insoluble fraction both wtHtt and mHtt were ubiquitinated at K6 and K9, but label-free quantification (LFQ) revealed that mHtt ubiquitination at these sites was increased compared with wtHtt. Further, we found increased levels of ubiquitin and K48 polyubiquitin linkages in the insoluble fraction. Also, several proteins with roles in membrane organization, transport, mRNA processing, gene transcription, translation, catabolic processes and oxidative phosphorylation were differentially expressed or ubiquitinated in wild-type and mutant huntingtin brain tissues. Finally, most proteins in the soluble fraction 

showed stable expression levels in wtHtt and mHtt samples and thus did not affect diGly site fold changes in general. This suggests that diGly site fold changes were the result of increased ubiquitination. In the insoluble fraction several proteins showed increased protein and diGly site levels, suggesting that protein fold changes contributed to diGly site fold changes for these proteins. This was for instance the case for ubiquitin, ubiquilin-2, sequestosome-1/p62 and myosin VA (myo5a). Our data gives more insight in the ubiquitination of huntingtin and other proteins in soluble and insoluble fractions of late stage HD mice brain lysates. The findings presented here could be the basis for further mechanistic studies to understand the role of ubiquitin signaling in HD. 

## EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
 

Experimental Design and Statistical Rationale—Global proteome and ubiquitinome of soluble and insoluble fractions derived from wild-type Htt mice brain (wtHtt, expressing full-length Htt with 20 polyQ repeats, control) and mutant Htt mice brain (mHtt, expressing full-length Htt with 175 polyQ repeats) were analyzed using label-free mass spectrometry. Four biological replicates of mutants and wild types were analyzed in each experiment to validate the biological reliability of measurements. For the soluble fraction, three fractions were measured for each sample. Both for global and diGly analyses, proteins and diGly sites that were identified in at least 3 out of 4 replicates both in wild-type and mutant groups were used for comparison. Student’s t test was performed for comparisons between wtHtt and mHtt with 1% FDR cutoff for all datasets. Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry—Snap frozen whole brains excluding cerebellum derived from 40 weeks old mice of strain HttQ20 (wild type) and strain Q175F neo delete/Q175FDN (mutant, homozygous) (25), were provided by the Jackson Lab (www.jax.org). Frozen brains were grinded in small pieces using a metal bar in a liquid nitrogen bath, and dissolved in a mild lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH7; 150 mM NaCl; 1% Triton X-100; Roche protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany); 200 �M PR-619; 1 mM EDTA; 100 mM Chloroacetamide (CAA)) using a glass douncer on ice. Lysates were centrifuged through a 70 micron filter (EASYstrainer, Greiner Bio-One B.V., Alphen a/d Rijn, The Netherlands) and DNA was sheared by sonication (Bioruptor Pico, Diagenode, Seraing, Belgium). Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min with 14,000 rpm by 4 °C to separate soluble (monomeric and oligomeric Htt) and insoluble (fibrils, aggregates and inclusion bodies) huntingtin fractions (26). Proteins of the soluble fraction were denatured by addition of 10 volumes of 8 M urea lysis buffer (8 M urea; 50 mM Tris/HCl pH8; 50 mM NaCl). The pellet or insoluble fraction was washed several times in the mild lysis buffer. Next, the Htt aggregates in the pellets were solubilized as described before (23) with some small adjustments. Briefly, aggregates were solubilized by resuspension in one pellet volume of formic acid and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min with 1000 rpm shaking and dried by speedvac O/N. Pellets were dissolved in 8 M urea-based lysis buffer. Protein quantification was performed for soluble and insoluble fractions using the Bradford assay (Serva Electrophoresis GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Four biological replicates of 20 mg total protein for soluble fractions and 3 mg protein for insoluble fractions were made for both wild-type and mutant samples. Arg-C/chymotrypsin and Lys-C/trypsin Digestion of Soluble Fractions—Ten milligrams total protein of each sample was used for Arg-C/chymotrypsin digestion. Samples were diluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH8 to a final concentration of 2 M urea. Proteins were reduced using 5 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) for 45 min at RT. CaAc
