Table I gives the amount of proteins and diGly sites in these categories, whereas supplemental Table S5 gives information about these proteins and diGly sites. The distribution of their intensities together with those that were significantly changed are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. 

In addition to mHtt, other proteins can also become insoluble because of sequestration in mHtt aggregates. We looked whether this was the case in our analysis by plotting the overlap between significantly up and downregulated proteins in the soluble and insoluble fractions (Fig. 2D). Significant

FIG. 1. Workflow of mass spectrometry sample preparation. A, Schematic representation of the used protein digestion method. A sequential digestion of Arg-C/chymotrypsin and Lys-C/trypsin was performed with the aim to obtain peptides containing all putative N-terminal Htt ubiquitination sites. The cleavage sites of trypsin and Lys-C are shown in white, whereas cleavage sites of chymotrypsin are shown in bold black. B, Simplified schematic representation of the workflow from lysate to data analysis for both the global ubiquitinome and global proteome analysis. Wild-type and mutant samples were made in quadruplicates, here the workflow is shown for just one sample. Triton X-100 soluble and insoluble fractions were obtained. Putative Htt aggregates in the insoluble fraction (pellets) were solubilized by formic acid treatment. Soluble fractions were digested as described in Fig. 1A. To reduce complexity, the soluble fractions were further fractionated by high pH RP fractionation. Insoluble fractions were digested only with Lys-C and trypsin. Further fractionation was not required based on the amount of protein in these samples. Global proteome and ubiquitin-modified proteome analyses were performed for each fraction or sample using the MaxQuant and Perseus platforms.
