In Brief Label-free quantitative mass spectrometry techniques were applied to discover proteome and ubiquitinome changes in brain tissue of Huntington’s disease mouse model Q175FDN and wild-type mice. Triton X-100 soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed, revealing differential ubiquitination of wild-type and mutant Huntingtin in both. Cellular processes affected by the disease include vesicular transport, gene expression, translation, catabolic processes and oxidative phosphorylation. DiGly site fold changes with respect to protein fold changes were different between soluble and insoluble fractions.
